Project Brief

Create a mobile first/responsive version of the product page on http://www.mass.fi. Your challenge here is to understand what is being displayed on the product page as it’s unlikely to be in your native language. All the information that is currently on that page should be retained, but you can make your own decisions on layout. You must explain and justify your layout choices.

You can use whatever framework or code you like, please don’t re use any of the code we have on the site. I am looking for code quality as well as the end result. The Hut Group is the client and will be able to provide additional information to help you gain a better insight into the mass.fi customer. You just need to ask the right questions to enable you to provide a suitable solution.

This feature must work across all supported devices and browsers. Graceful degradation is allowed but you decisions must be backed up with good reasons. You must be able to demonstrate the prototype on a several devices (emulators or physical devices). You must show you have used version control where appropriate. Please make it clear on any work that these are university project prototypes and do what you can to avoid search engines picking up the pages.
